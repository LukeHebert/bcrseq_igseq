## More important

- Remove all absolute pathways and replace with user arguments to the corresponding software

- Work on the final BCRseq-IgSeq merging script to squeeze all valid mappings from the input datasets (e.g. a peptide "information" score?)

- Add clustering alternatives. At the very least, one should allow for (rare) indels to be clustered together

- Add a VH-VL pair-picking script to help mAb selection & downstream expression

- Add EMPEM data integration scripts?

## Less Important

- Integrate all scripts into a cohesive, user-friendly, bonafide pipeline with a tool like e.g. snakemake

- Include all dependencies in a container or similar

- Create (or at least update old) generally useful plotting scripts

- Make the workflow diagram darker

- Update README.md to guide users through a "pipeline" run.
