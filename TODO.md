- Update README.md to guide users through a "pipeline" run.

- Create (or at least update old) generally useful plotting scripts

- Work on the final BCRseq-IgSeq merging script to squeeze all valid mappings from the input datasets (e.g. a peptide "information" score?)

- Add clustering alternatives that, at the very least, allow for indels to be clustered together.

- Add a VH-VL pair-picking script to help mAb selection & downstream expression

- Add EMPEM data integration scripts?

- Integrate all scripts into a cohesive, user-friendly, bonafide pipeline with a tool like e.g. snakemake
